## If You Need IEEE Papers Instead:

If your assignment requires IEEE Xplore papers specifically, you would need to replace these references with papers that are actually published in IEEE journals/conferences. Some suggestions:

- **IEEE Transactions on Cloud Computing**
- **IEEE Transactions on Services Computing**
- **IEEE Cloud Computing**
- **IEEE International Conference on Cloud Computing**
- **IEEE Symposium on Cloud Computing**

Would you like me to help you find alternative IEEE papers on similar topics?
